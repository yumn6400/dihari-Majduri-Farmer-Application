The Dihari-Majduri project is a Java Enterprise Application designed to assist farmers in managing and maintaining their laborers' wages efficiently. This application provides a streamlined solution for farmers to track the employment periods, work types, and payment records of their laborers, ensuring accurate and timely wage management.

Backend Technology Stack ---->
Spring Boot: The core of the backend is built using Spring Boot, a robust and efficient framework for developing enterprise-level applications. It facilitates rapid development, scalability, and ease of integration with other technologies.

Hibernate: Hibernate ORM is utilized for seamless interaction with the MySQL database. It simplifies database operations by mapping Java objects to database tables, allowing developers to work with high-level data abstractions without worrying about SQL queries.

AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming): AOP is employed to handle cross-cutting concerns such as logging, transaction management, and security without cluttering the business logic. This leads to a cleaner and more maintainable codebase.

Spring Security: To safeguard sensitive information and ensure that only authorized users have access to certain functionalities, Spring Security is integrated into the application. It provides authentication, authorization, and other security mechanisms.

Database
MySQL: The application's data is stored in a MySQL database, which is known for its reliability, performance, and ease of use. It holds records related to labor employment periods, wages, crop work types, and more.
